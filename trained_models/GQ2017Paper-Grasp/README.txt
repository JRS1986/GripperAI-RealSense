# DEX-NET 2.0 GRASP QUALITY CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (GQ-CNN) WEIGHTS

# OVERVIEW
This directory contains the weights of the GQ-CNN trained on 6.7 million point clouds, grasps, and grasp metrics from Dex-Net 2.0 generated from 1,500 3D object models from the KIT and 3DNet datasets.
The network was trained on January 24, 2017.
For more information on the dataset, architecture, and training method, please see our paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09312.
The model is referred to as "GQ" in the Experiments section of the paper (Section VI).
